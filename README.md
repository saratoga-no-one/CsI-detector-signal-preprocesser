# CsI-detector-signal-preprocesser 
This is a simple tool to preprocess CsI detector's event file. 
It provided functions to split events from a .bin file and convert them to .dat text file(You can use OriginLab to open it.) 
And there are some preprocess functions to down sampling the origin signal. 
To align the baseline, you can calculate the difference of signal(This won't reserve energy information) or other ways.
